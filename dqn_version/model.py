Deep Q-Learning Model and Training Module
-------------------------------------------

This module implements a deep Q-learning framework using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
for a 4x4 Tic Tac Toe reinforcement learning agent. It contains two main classes:

    1. ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork (inherits from torch.nn.Module):
       - Defines a CNN architecture with convolutional and fully-connected layers
         to approximate Q-values given a board state.
       - The forward method expects input in shape [N, 4, 4] (with N being the batch size)
         and internally adds the required channel dimension.

    2. QvalueTrainer:
       - Encapsulates the training procedure for the neural network.
       - Converts input data (states, actions, rewards, next_states, done flags) from numpy arrays to torch tensors.
       - Handles both single-sample and batch inputs by ensuring data is treated as a batch.
       - Implements the Bellman equation to update target Q-values:
         the updated reward is calculated using the next state's value according to the Bellman equation.
       - Performs backpropagation using the Adam optimizer and an MSE loss function.

Usage:
    The module is designed to be used as part of a reinforcement learning training pipeline.
    Call the QvalueTrainer.train_step() method during training to update the network parameters.
    
Note:
    This implementation focuses on the conversion of raw data to the proper tensor format and
    the integration of the Bellman update within the training step.
    
Example:
    >>> model = ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork()
    >>> trainer = QvalueTrainer(model, lr=0.001, gamma=0.9)
    >>> trainer.train_step(states, actions, rewards, next_states, done)

This module was built from scratch using PyTorch and numpy, without relying on higher-level frameworks,
to provide deeper insight into the inner workings of deep Q-learning.
